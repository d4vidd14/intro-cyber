# Malware Concepts (Defensive Glossary)

## Core definitions
- **Malware**: any software designed to harm, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access.
- **Trojan (Troyano)**: malware disguised as legitimate software; relies on user execution.
- **Worm (Gusano)**: self-propagates across systems/networks without user action.
- **Spyware**: collects information (credentials, browsing, screenshots) without consent.
- **Ransomware**: encrypts or steals data and demands payment.

## Antivirus / detection concepts
- **AV (Antivirus/EPP)**: endpoint protection that detects known malware and suspicious behavior.
- **Signature (Firma)**: known pattern/hash/byte sequence used to identify malware.
- **Heuristics (Heurística)**: rule/behavior-based detection (suspicious patterns rather than exact signature).
- **Sandbox**: isolated environment to execute and observe behavior safely.

### Scan-time vs Run-time
- **Scan-time**: detection when files are scanned (on access / on demand).
- **Run-time**: detection while the program is executing (behavior monitoring).

## Malware behavior & techniques (high level)
- **Persistence (Persistencia)**: techniques to survive reboots and remain present (e.g., services, scheduled tasks).
- **Obfuscation (Ofuscación)**: making code harder to analyze or detect (packing, encoding, anti-analysis).
- **Time bomb (Bomba de tiempo)**: triggers malicious action at a specific time or condition.
- **Rootkit**: hides malware presence by manipulating the OS/kernel/userland to conceal files/processes/registry entries.

## Analysis & response
- **Debugger (Depurador)**: tool used to inspect program execution (used by analysts; also abused by malware for anti-debug checks).
- **Assembly (Ensamblador)**: low-level language representation; useful for reverse engineering basics.
- **NOP**: “no operation” instruction (common in low-level contexts; often mentioned in exploit/dev or obfuscation discussions).

## Indicators
- **IoC (Indicator of Compromise)**: evidence of compromise (hash, domain, IP, filename, registry key, mutex, etc.).
- **IoA (Indicator of Attack)**: behavior pattern suggesting an attack (e.g., unusual process tree, credential dumping activity).

## Additional terms often mentioned (context only)
*(These terms are sometimes used in malware-building discussions; included here as definitions, not instructions.)*
- **FUD**: “Fully Undetectable” (marketing term implying AV evasion).
- **Crypter / Packer**: software that transforms/packets executables to hinder analysis/detection.
- **Binder / Joiner**: combines multiple files into one package (often abused).
- **Builder / Stub**: “builder” creates a configured sample; “stub” is a small loader component.
- **EOF**: end-of-file marker/region; sometimes referenced in file format manipulation.

## Practical takeaway (Blue Team)
- Prefer defense-in-depth: patching + least privilege + EDR + email/web controls + backups (for ransomware).
- Use IoCs for quick blocking/triage and IoAs for hunting/behavior-based detection.
