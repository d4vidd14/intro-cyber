# OSI vs TCP/IP

## OSI Model (7 layers)
1. Physical
2. Data Link
3. Network
4. Transport
5. Session
6. Presentation
7. Application

### Examples
- L2: Ethernet, MAC addresses
- L3: IP (IPv4/IPv6), routing
- L4: TCP/UDP (ports)
- L7: HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, SMTP

## TCP/IP Model (simplified)
- Link (OSI 1–2)
- Internet (OSI 3)
- Transport (OSI 4)
- Application (OSI 5–7)

## Why this matters in cybersecurity
- Helps locate where a problem/attack happens (e.g., DNS spoofing = application layer; port scanning = transport layer; ARP spoofing = data link layer).
