# Cybersecurity Fundamentals — Notes & Mini Labs

This repository contains my personal notes and small hands-on labs covering cybersecurity and networking fundamentals. The goal is to build a clear foundation and keep everything reproducible.

## Contents
### Notes
- OSI vs TCP/IP
- Connectivity basics (MAC/IP, public vs private, subnet masks, DHCP, DNS, TCP/UDP/ICMP, ports vs sockets)
- Network components (firewalls, routers/switches, proxies, IDS/IPS, VPN, etc.)

### Mini Labs
- Windows networking commands (ipconfig, routes, hosts file)
- Linux networking commands (ip a, ip r, ss, /etc/hosts)
- Basic connectivity checks (ping, traceroute/tracert)

## Environment
- Windows 11 host
- Optional lab: VirtualBox (Kali + Ubuntu)

## How I use this repo
For each topic I add:
- a short note (Markdown)
- a small lab (commands + outputs)
- key takeaways / checklist

## Source
The structure is inspired by an introductory cybersecurity course, expanded with my own notes and labs.
